# NVIDIA Air Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# DO NOT commit .env to version control!

# Required: Your NVIDIA Air API token
# Get this from: Air website → Account Settings → API Tokens
AIR_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here

# Required: Your Air account email/username
AIR_USERNAME=your_email@nvidia.com

# Optional: NVIDIA Air API URL
# Uncomment one of the following based on which Air site you're using:

# External NVIDIA Air (default)
AIR_API_URL=https://air.nvidia.com

# Internal NVIDIA Air (NVIDIA employees only - requires VPN)
# AIR_API_URL=https://air-inside.nvidia.com

# SSH Key Configuration
# These are used for:
# 1. Cloud-init to add your public key to simulation nodes
# 2. SSH config file for connecting to the simulation

# Path to your SSH private key (for connecting)
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Path to your SSH public key (added to nodes via cloud-init)
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# Optional: Override where deploy_bcm_air.py writes the generated SSH config file.
# If unset, the default is: ./.ssh/<simulation_name_with_spaces_replaced_by_dashes>
# (e.g. ./.ssh/202512001-BCM-Lab)
#
# You can use placeholders:
#   - {simulation_name}
#   - {simulation_name_slug}   (spaces replaced with '-')
#   - {simulation_id}
#
# Examples:
# AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE=~/.ssh/air/external/{simulation_name_slug}
# AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE=~/.ssh/air/internal/{simulation_id}
# AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE=~/.ssh/air/external/    # (directory; file will be appended automatically)
# AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE=./.ssh/external/{simulation_name_slug}
# AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE=./.ssh/internal/{simulation_name_slug}
# AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE=./.ssh/internal/{simulation_id}
# AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE=./.ssh/internal/        # (directory; file will be appended automatically)
# AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE=

# Optional: Local namespace for on-disk artifacts created by deploy_bcm_air.py
# (primarily .logs/progress.json and the default .ssh/ output path).
#
# If set, deploy_bcm_air.py will use:
#   - ./.logs/<LOCAL_NAMESPACE>/progress.json
#   - ./.ssh/<LOCAL_NAMESPACE>/<simulation_name_slug>  (when AIR_SSH_CONFIG_FILE is not set)
#
# This is useful for running one external and one internal deploy concurrently without collisions.
# Example:
# LOCAL_NAMESPACE=e   # in .env.external
# LOCAL_NAMESPACE=i   # in .env.internal
# LOCAL_NAMESPACE=

# BCM Configuration
# These are used to generate ansible/cm-bright-setup.conf

# Required: Your BCM product key (from NVIDIA licensing)
BCM_PRODUCT_KEY=your_product_key_here

# Optional: Admin email for BCM notifications
BCM_ADMIN_EMAIL=your_email@nvidia.com

# Optional: For WSL users to suppress hardlink warnings
# UV_LINK_MODE=copy
